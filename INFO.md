# Documentation

## 1. **Project Layout**

- **`/cmd`**: Contains the application's entry points. Each subdirectory in `/cmd` is named for an executable, and each contains a `main.go` file. For example, `/cmd/api` for your web API.

- **`/internal`**: Contains your application code. This is where the bulk of your code lives. The `/internal` directory is a Go convention to indicate that the code in this directory is private to your application.

- **`/internal/pkg` or `/pkg`**: Contains library code that's ok to use by external applications. Use `/internal/pkg` if you want to ensure it's only used within your project.

- **`/internal/handlers`**: Contains your HTTP handlers (or controllers in MVC terms). Each file or subdirectory represents a group of related handlers (e.g., MEPs, documents).

- **`/internal/models`**: Contains your application's data models. These structs represent the data and can include methods for querying, updating, and deleting that data.

- **`/internal/services`**: Contains the business logic of your application. Services interact with models and perform the core operations of your application.

- **`/internal/repository`**: Contains code for data access layer. It is responsible for querying the database or external APIs.

- **`/config`**: Contains configuration files and scripts.

- **`/test`**: Contains additional external test apps and test data. You can have a test version of your API or mock servers here.

## 2. **Dependency Management**

- Use Go Modules (`go mod`) for dependency management. It's the official dependency management system in Go.

## 3. **Configuration**

- Consider using environment variables or configuration files (like JSON, YAML, or TOML) to manage your application configuration. Libraries like `viper` can be helpful.

## 4. **Logging and Error Handling**

- Implement a consistent logging and error handling strategy. You can use a logging library like `logrus` or `zap` for structured logging.

## 5. **Testing**

- Write tests for your code. Place your tests in the same directory as the code they test with a `_test.go` suffix.

## 6. **Documentation**

- Keep your documentation up-to-date. Document your API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger or similar tools.

## 7. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
